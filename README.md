# C-13X

![](images/new-bottom.png)

I modified the bottom so it can accept ai03 daughterboards for use with the [PCB I designed](https://github.com/ramonimbao/C-13X-PCB).

# C-13X
qaz-ish alice style handwired board

## features
- qaz-ish alice layout
- gasket mount
- 5mm thick plate
- clear window on the back to display wiring
- via support (if you choose to wire the matrix the same as I did)

## you will need:
- 35x mx style switches
- 35x diodes
- elite-c controller (the cutout on the bottom is specifically designed for an elite-c, so a promicro will not work)
- wires of your choice
- gaskets (This is designed to work with KBDFans's D65 gaskets, but any gaskets should work as long as they are not over 4mm wide)
- 8x m2x6 screws
- (optional) 2x 2u plate mount stabilizers
- (optional) bumpons/feet (I used 3m sj1502s, but any feet 8mm in diameter should work)
- (optional) clear plastic/acryllic sheet for the window on the back

### note for those who want to use the provided firmware
- should go without saying, but the board has to be wired exactly as the "matrix.png" shows for the firmware to work
- use qmk toolbox to flash the hex file onto the board
- to get the board properly showing up in via, you will need to go into via > file > import keymap and then select the "C-13X.json" file, then it should show up
